AR Validations
==============

This ActiveRecord extension provides more validation schemes. There are some useful validation missing added by this plugin to fill the gap.

Available validations are :

* *email*: It checks for presence, length, format and uniqueness. There is no guarantee that a validated email is real and deliverable.
* *URLs*: It checks for validity of the link by contacting it. If not protocol is not specified, it'll automatically add "http://" in front of the url.

Installation
------------

In your Rails app root, use the following command-line : 

	cd vendor/plugins
	hg clone http://bitbucket.org/Bounga/ar-validations/
	
or install it system-wide :

	$ sudo gem install ar-validations
	
and require it in Rails::Initializer (environment.rb) :

	config.gem 'ar-validations'


Example
-------

In your model :

	class User < ActiveRecord::Base
      validates_email :email
      validates_url :url
    end
